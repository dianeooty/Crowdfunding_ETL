# Crowdfunding-ETL
Project 2 of my Data Analytics and Visualization Boot Camp is to build an ETL pipeline using Python and Pandas where the data is extracted, transformed and loaded.

## General Information
Using two datasets, crowdfunding campaign and contacts. Using Python dictionaries and regular expressions to create four different dataframes: Category, Subcategory, Contacts and Campaign. Then cleaning the data by checking data types, column names and reordering. After saving the finalized dataframes as csv file, I sketched an ERD and created a database schema.  The schema was used to create tables in Postgresql where the csv files of the dataframe were imported. 


## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Postgresql

## Setup
An image of the ERD and the database schema can be referenced in the repository file. All excel and csv files are located in the Resources folder for reference.


## Project Status
Project is complete and no longer being worked on.
